# cli-typing-test

_A simple CLI-based typing test, originally an AP CSP final project_

This was originally created as my submission for AP Computer Science Principle's "Create Task" (a final project submitted to college board as a component of the AP Exam; I got a 5). Pretty much the simplest way to build something like this, it just pulls randomly from wikipedia's list of 1000 most common words (with a few exclusions) and has you type them. Has a pretty nice UI, at least considering I had no idea how to make one in a CLI at the time. Gives you WPM and a few other stats at the end. 

**Built in .net 6.0**
